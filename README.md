## Sam Kahn's Portfolio

Hi there!

Have a look through the [site](https://kamsahn.github.io/) to see my projects and skills. I've put some flavor text and contact info on there as well. I am typically most responsive via email. If you're curious, poke around this repo a bit to see how the portfolio looks under the hood. It's a modified Bootstrap template. Still thinking about changing up some of the colors, but I hope you enjoy!

As of 4/9/19 I still have another project to add to my portfolio - a Pokemon TCG deck builder, using the MERN stack as well as a 3rd party API for the cards. Should be up in a couple weeks to be sure to check that out!

Thanks for stopping by!

-Sam
